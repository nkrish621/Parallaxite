    <h2>CRAZY FACTS ABOUT SPACE</h2>
    <p>
	There is so much about space, our solar system, and the galaxy that we still don't know!  Space is vast. With billions of galaxies and stars, and planets in our own solar system yet to be fully explored or understood, scientists' knowledge of space is always evolving.  There are, however, some really cool things we know about space right now!  We've compiled a list of what we think are ten stellar facts that we hope you'll think are out of this world!

    <h2>THERE ARE MORE STARS IN THE UNIVERSE THAN GRAINS OF SANDS ON EARTH</h2>
    <p>
     The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.

    <h2>THE HOTTEST PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS 450° C</h2>
    <p>
	Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations.
